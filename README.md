# Mobile-Data-Analysis
Mobile data analysis using Python and web scraping — my first project, with room to grow and lots learned.

# 📱 Mobile Data Analysis Project

This is a data science project where I scraped mobile phone data from Amazon India, cleaned the data, and visualized it to understand the pricing, ratings, and brand trends.

## 🔧 What This Project Does

- Scrapes mobile phone data for brands like Samsung, Vivo, Realme, Redmi, Oppo, and Motorola from amazon website
- Collects information such as brand name, model name, price, ratings, reviews, and connectivity (4G or 5G)
- Cleans the dataset by removing duplicates, fixing brand/model names, and filtering out refurbished phones
